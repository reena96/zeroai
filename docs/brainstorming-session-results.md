## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes

**Description:** Explored provocative "what if" questions to unlock creative possibilities around student behavior detection and adaptive tutoring.

**Key Question Explored:**
"What if the AI Math Tutor could 'feel' when a student is frustrated or confused - not just from their words, but from their behavior in the interface?"

#### Ideas Generated:

1. **Behavioral Sensing Framework**
   - Time-based signals: pause duration, session length, response speed patterns
   - Input quality patterns: deletion/correction frequency, response length, repeated errors
   - Interaction patterns: clicking behavior, hint usage, navigation patterns

2. **Adaptive Wait-Time System**
   - Context-aware intervention timing (not fixed 30-second timeout)
   - Problem difficulty as primary factor (Easy/Medium/Hard classification)
   - Student historical performance as calibration data
   - Mode-dependent tolerance (Practice vs. Test mode)

3. **Problem Difficulty Calibration System**
   - Three-tier difficulty classification (Easy/Medium/Hard)
   - Time constraints calibrated per difficulty level
   - Source difficulty ratings from established testing sites
   - Different time allowances based on selected learning mode

4. **Learning Mode Framework**
   - **Practice Mode:** Relaxed, no time pressure, focus on understanding
   - **Test Mode:** Timed challenges with stricter constraints (stretch feature)
   - **Learning Intensity Levels:**
     - Adaptive Learning (gentle, patient)
     - Intermediate Learning (structured time limits)
     - Rigorous Learning (strict, test-prep focused)

5. **Intervention Trigger System**
   - Behavior-triggered interventions (not purely time-based)
   - Long pause + no typing activity = offer hint
   - Multiple wrong attempts = adjust scaffolding level
   - Explicit help requests = immediate support
   - Example thresholds: 2-3 min for easy problems, 5+ min for hard problems

6. **EdTech Industry Alignment - Khan Academy Approach (RECOMMENDED FOR MVP)**
   - Pure adaptive learning with mastery-based progression
   - No strict time limits in practice mode
   - Patient Socratic dialogue that values "struggle time"
   - Hints available but not pushy
   - Behavior detection over time enforcement

7. **Differentiation Strategy**
   - Question to explore: "What makes YOUR tutor different from Khan Academy's demo?"
   - Opportunity for unique angle/innovation (to be explored in next session)

8. **MVP Feature Prioritization Decision**
   - Start with Practice Mode only (no time pressure)
   - Use LLM to estimate problem difficulty from image/text
   - Implement behavior-triggered interventions
   - Save Test Mode / Rigor Levels as stretch features

#### Insights Discovered:
- Fixed time limits (like 30 seconds) are too rigid - context matters enormously
- Problem complexity must drive intervention timing, not arbitrary thresholds
- Socratic pedagogy aligns best with patient, understanding-focused approach (vs. speed-focused)
- Khan Academy model is closest inspiration but leaves room for differentiation

#### Notable Connections:
- Behavioral sensing connects to UX design decisions
- Learning modes connect to evaluation criteria (pedagogical quality > speed)
- EdTech research validates patience-over-pressure approach
- 3-5 day timeline favors simpler MVP with one mode, extensible architecture

## Decision Points Reached

### ✅ Confirmed Decisions:
1. **Implement behavioral sensing system** tracking time patterns, input quality, and interaction patterns
2. **Problem difficulty classification** using Easy/Medium/Hard tiers
3. **Start with Practice Mode only** for MVP (aligns with Socratic approach and timeline)
4. **Behavior-triggered interventions** rather than strict time limits
5. **Khan Academy-inspired approach** as foundation (adaptive, patient, understanding-focused)

### 🔄 Open Questions for Next Session:
1. What makes this tutor uniquely different from Khan Academy's demo?
2. Which creative stretch features provide maximum differentiation?
3. How to implement the behavioral sensing technically within 3-5 days?
4. What specific Role Playing perspectives will unlock best ideas? (student/teacher/parent/competitor?)

## Next Steps

**When Session Resumes:**
- **Phase 2:** Divergent Generation with Role Playing and Analogical Thinking (20-30 min)
- **Phase 3:** Convergent Refinement with SCAMPER method (15-20 min)
- **Phase 4:** Synthesis with full categorization and action planning (10-15 min)

**Estimated remaining time:** 45-60 minutes

## Session Notes

**What Worked Well:**
- "What If" scenarios successfully opened up behavioral intelligence possibilities
- Pushed back appropriately on oversimplified assumptions (30-second timeout)
- Connected ideas to real EdTech industry practices
- Made concrete MVP-vs-stretch feature decisions

**Energy Level:** High engagement, strategic thinking evident
