## Script Outline

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**Visual:** zeroai logo / landing page

**Voiceover:**
> "Meet zeroai - the AI math tutor that actually adapts to YOUR learning situation. Whether you're rushing through homework at 9pm or exploring calculus for fun on a weekend, zeroai guides you to understanding without just giving you the answer."

**Key Message:** Context-aware, Socratic, adaptive

---

### Segment 1: Problem Input Methods (0:30 - 1:15)

#### Part A: Text Input (0:30 - 0:50)

**Visual:** Type problem into chat: "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13"

**Voiceover:**
> "Enter any math problem as plain text - no special formatting needed. The AI instantly confirms what you're working on..."

**Screen shows:** AI responds: "I see you want to solve 2x + 5 = 13. Let's work through this together!"

**Key Message:** Natural language input, problem confirmation

#### Part B: Image Upload + OCR (0:50 - 1:15)

**Visual:** Click "Upload Image" button → select photo of handwritten problem "3x - 7 = 14"

**Voiceover:**
> "Or take a photo of your homework. GPT-4 Vision extracts the problem from handwritten or printed text, and the dialogue begins immediately."

**Screen shows:** OCR extraction → AI confirms problem → starts Socratic dialogue

**Key Message:** Image upload, OCR capability, seamless transition

---

### Segment 2: Context-Aware Modes (1:15 - 2:30)

#### Part A: Homework Help Mode (1:15 - 1:50)

**Visual:** Select "Homework Help" mode → problem: "Solve: x² - 9 = 0"

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's where zeroai gets unique. Select 'Homework Help' when you're under a deadline. The AI adapts its pacing - asking 2-3 efficient questions per concept, balancing speed with genuine understanding."

**Screen shows:**
- AI: "What operation undoes the squared term?" [Q1]
- Student: "Square root?"
- AI: "Let's think about factoring. Can you recognize this as a² - b²?" [Q2]
- Student clicks "I'm really confused"
- AI provides worked example: "Let me show you a similar problem: y² - 16 = 0..."
- Student applies pattern, solves correctly

**Key Message:** Fast pacing, worked example scaffolding, student agency

#### Part B: Exploration Mode (1:50 - 2:30)

**Visual:** New chat → Select "Exploration" mode → same problem: "Solve: x² - 9 = 0"

**Voiceover:**
> "But when you're exploring for fun, the same AI transforms. Exploration mode asks 5-7 patient questions, encouraging you to discover 'why' things work, not just 'how'."

**Screen shows:**
- AI: "What does this equation tell us?" [Q1 - conceptual]
- Student: "x squared minus 9 equals zero?"
- AI: "Perfect! Now what patterns do you notice?" [Q2]
- AI: "Think about difference of squares. What's the formula?" [Q3]
- AI: "How would you factor a² - b²?" [Q4]
- [Continue showing patient, deep exploration]

**Key Message:** Slow pacing, deep questions, "why" focus

---

### Segment 3: Socratic Method in Action (2:30 - 3:30)

#### The Magic: Never Gives Direct Answers (2:30 - 3:00)

**Visual:** Problem: "Simplify: 5x + 3(2x - 4) + 7" in Homework mode

**Voiceover:**
> "The core magic of zeroai: it NEVER gives you the answer directly. Watch the Socratic dialogue unfold..."

**Screen shows:**
- AI: "What's the first step to simplify this expression?"
- Student: "Add 5x and 2x?"
- AI: "Not quite. We need to distribute first. What does 3(2x - 4) become?"
- Student: "6x - 12?"
- AI: "Exactly! So now we have 5x + 6x - 12 + 7. Combine like terms..."
- [Continue until student reaches answer: 11x - 5]
- AI: "Perfect! Final answer: 11x - 5 ✓"

**Key Message:** Socratic questioning, gentle correction, verification

#### Intelligent Scaffolding (3:00 - 3:30)

**Visual:** Continue previous problem, show hint ladder escalation

**Voiceover:**
> "But here's the research-backed intelligence: when you're genuinely stuck after 2-3 attempts, the AI doesn't keep asking the same question. It escalates support..."

**Screen shows 3-step hint ladder:**
1. **Conceptual Cue:** "Think about order of operations..."
2. **Procedural Nudge:** "Try distributing the 3 first..."
3. **Partial Worked Step:** "Left side: 3(2x - 4) = 6x - 12. Now what?"

**Key Message:** Smart scaffolding, prevents frustration, maintains learning

---

### Segment 4: Student Agency & Control (3:30 - 4:00)

#### "I'm Really Confused" Button (3:30 - 4:00)

**Visual:** New problem → student struggles → clicks button

**Voiceover:**
> "And here's the ultimate student empowerment: when you're really confused, click the button. The AI immediately provides a worked example - NOT your exact problem, but a similar one you can learn from."

**Screen shows:**
- Student clicks "I'm really confused"
- AI: "No problem! Let me show you a similar problem to help you understand the pattern:

  **Similar Problem:** Solve: 3x + 2 = 11

  **Solution Steps:**
  1. Subtract 2 from both sides → 3x = 9
  2. Divide both sides by 3 → x = 3
  3. Check: 3(3) + 2 = 11 ✓

  Now apply this to your original problem: 2x + 5 = 13"

**Key Message:** Student control, worked examples, pattern application

---

### Segment 5: Math Rendering & UX Polish (4:00 - 4:30)

#### Beautiful Math (4:00 - 4:15)

**Visual:** Show various problems with LaTeX rendering

**Voiceover:**
> "Every equation is beautifully rendered with KaTeX - from simple fractions to quadratic formulas."

**Screen shows:**
- Inline math: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
- Display math: $$\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x) dx = 2$$
- Complex expressions: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n^2}$

**Key Message:** Professional math rendering, readability

#### Mobile Responsive (4:15 - 4:30)

**Visual:** Show app on phone, tablet, desktop

**Voiceover:**
> "Works seamlessly on any device - phone, tablet, or desktop. Your math help, wherever you are."

**Screen shows:** Responsive design across devices

**Key Message:** Cross-platform, mobile-first

### Segment 6: Results & Validation (4:30 - 4:50)

#### Test Results (4:30 - 4:50)

**Visual:** Show docs/test-results.md highlights

**Voiceover:**
> "The results speak for themselves: 20 out of 20 test scenarios passed. Zero direct answers given - perfect Socratic adherence. Average LLM response under 2 seconds. 95% Gauntlet readiness."

**Screen shows:**

## Alternative: Automated Demo (Playwright Script)

If recording manually is not feasible, consider using Playwright to automate the demo:

```typescript
// scripts/record-demo.ts
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

async function recordDemo() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const context = await browser.newContext({
    viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
    recordVideo: { dir: 'demo-videos/' },
  });

  const page = await context.newPage();

  // Segment 1: Text Input
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  await page.fill('input[placeholder="Enter a math problem..."]', 'Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Send")');
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000); // Wait for AI response

  // Segment 2: Image Upload
  await page.click('button[aria-label="Upload Image"]');
  await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', 'test-images/problem-1.png');
  await page.waitForTimeout(5000); // Wait for OCR + AI response

  // ... Continue for all segments

  await browser.close();
}

recordDemo();
```
